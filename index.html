I am interested in a career in engineering or computer science. I plan on this career because I am intrigued by the behind the scenes work programmers and engineers do and the process of creating items such as computers. Today technology is a key to our everyday lives and I want to learn more about how it works and how to create those items. &nbsp;I &nbsp;am interested in becoming an engineer because I like creating and building things even if it&#39;s online like coding. I want to build my coding skills by learning new coding languages. &nbsp;I plan to achieve this goal by working long hours, being dedicated, and focusing on work in the near future. Skills that will help me with getting into an engineering or computer science &nbsp;career are my coding skills in HTML and little python knowledge helping me be successful in the career. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The experiences I possess in this career is that I am currently taking the PLTW Computer Science Essentials class at Dublin High School. This has allowed me to gain skills in MIT App Inventor coding as well as python and improving my HTML coding skills. In this class some of the apps we have created include a guessing game, interview database and Digital doodle project. In the guessing game we allowed the user to put a number in and the other player to guess it. They are shown if their guess was lower or higher as well as how many guesses they have left. Through the interview database it tracks your responses during an interview and stores them in a location for later usage. &nbsp;In the Digital doodle project we explored how the user can draw on a picture they take. This task includes features such as a shutter, camera, canvas, accelerator sensor, pen width and pen color. &nbsp;These applications have allowed me to learn how I can incorporate these features to make apps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Some of my strengths are that I&#39;m organized and creative. I demonstrate creativity by making projects unique, adding more than what is required. I am optimistic which helps others become motivated and positive about a subject thus also engaging people in groups. I want to become better at using my socializing skills to talk to others. I plan on learning new coding languages by watching videos and learning through websites to help me get better at coding. As I learn new languages, this will help me succeed in my career. </span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c3"><span class="c2">Lastly, s</span><span class="c2">omething you should know about me is that I love music!! I have played the Alto saxophone since 4th grade which has been 5-6 years now and I really enjoy it. I am a part of the Dublin High School music program and I love being in it. </span><span class="c2">As a member of the Irish Guard, I spend hours upon hours of time practicing and competing with other schools in the Bay Area. Our marching band consists of roughly 300 musicians and we compete in WBA and NCBA in the 6A division. During the 2022 fall season with our show Visionary, &nbsp;we received 2nd place in the NCBA competition circuit and 4th in the WBA circuit. </span><span class="c2">In general, I also love listening to pop music. You will always find me listening to music whether its when cleaning my room or cooking. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8"></span></p></body></html>
